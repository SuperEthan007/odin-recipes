# odin-recipes

This is a project from The Odin Project where I'm building my chops with HTML. Once I complete this project, I would have demonstrated my skills in structing a HTML document properly, usings the correct tags, as well as my understanding of file structure. Once I have uploaded this to github, I would have demonstrated an understanding of basic git operations.
